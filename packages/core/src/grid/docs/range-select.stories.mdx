# Grid Range-Select

<cds-alert-group status="danger" cds-layout="m-b:lg">
  <cds-alert>
    This feature or component is <strong>experimental</strong> and has no defined support policy. Experimental features
    are subject to change at any time and are not stable.
  </cds-alert>
</cds-alert-group>

Each `cds-grid-cell` has a `selected` property and `selectedChange` event. The `cds-grid` component
combines the cell selection and can emit a single `rangeSelectionChange` which emits a list of currently
active/highlighted cells. Range selection can be diabled by setting the `rangeSelection` property on `cds-grid`. Mouse based
range selection is automatically disabled for draggable rows.

- **Mouse Drag** Click a cell and drag the cursor to a different cell. All cells between the two will be marked as active.
- **Shift + Arrow Keys** Hold shift and use the arrow keysto focus to another cell. All cells between the two will be marked as active.

## Context Menu Range Selection

Using a combination of Range Selection and Dropdowns you can create action context menus
that can apply to a range of selected cells.
